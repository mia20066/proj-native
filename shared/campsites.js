        '2-5 Eggplant/n'+
        '3- 1 lb. Ground Beef/n'+
        '4- 1¼ cups Long Grain Rice/n'+
        '5- 1½ tsp. 7 Spices/n'+
        '6- ¼ tsp. Cinnamon/n'+
        '7- 1 tsp. Salt/n'+
        '8- ½ tsp. Black Pepper/n'+
        '9- 1 Tomato/n'+
        '10- ¼ cup Tomato Paste/n'+
        '11- 3 Clove of Garlic/n'+
        '12- 1 tsp. Dried Mint/n'+
        '13- 8 cups Water/n/n'+
       'Instructions\n'+
'1-Prepare your zucchini by cutting off the stems and ends. Prepare the eggplant by rolling them on a hard surface (like your countertop) using the palm of your hand to soften the insides which will make it easier to hallow out. Proceed to cut the stems off the eggplant after you have rolled them.\n'+
'2-Hallow out the squash and eggplant using the corer. Try not to be too rough as you will crack the squash with the corer. Also, it is easier to core them if they are at room temperature rather than cold. \n'+
'3-Once you have cored them, wash them well with cold water and set aside in a strainer.\n'+
'4-Prepare the filling by washing the rice 2-3 times. Combine the rice, ground beef, cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of salt, black pepper, and 7 Spices. Mix well but be careful not to break the rice as it is sensitive when not cooked. \n'+
'5-Stuff the squash and eggplant with your filling. Do not overfill or they will explode while cooking. Leave about 1 inch of room at the top. \n'+
'6-Cut a medium sized tomato into chunks. Put one chunk of tomato in each of the stuffed squash and eggplant. This helps the filling stay inside\n'+
'7-Place all the stuffed squash and eggplant into a large pot. Add the tomato paste, crushed garlic, and season with salt and pepper.\n'+
'8-Fill with hot water until all the squash are covered. For me, this took about 8 cups of water. Cook on medium-high heat for 30 minutes.\n'+
'9-After the 30 minutes, add the dried mint. Cook for an additional 5-10 minutes.\n'+
'Serve warm plain or with cold yogurt. Enjoy!'
